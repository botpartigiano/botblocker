1 - Getting your Twitter API Keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As I'm providing the complete code of this project, I can't let you guys use my API keys, so you need to get them yourselves. This is how you do it:

- 

If you installed the package using pip, you can simply run botblocker in the command line:

::

   botblocker

You can also run the script directly by ``botblocker.py``:

::

   python3 -W ignore -m botblocker
